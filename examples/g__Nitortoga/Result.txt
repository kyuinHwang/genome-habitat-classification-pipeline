GCA_013168275.1	PRJDB5415	Nitrotoga sp. AM1 Genome sequencing	Nitrotoga is one of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), which carry out the second step of nitrification and uses nitrite as sole energy for growth. Members of genus Nitrotoga are only belonging to class betaproteobacteria. "Candidatus Nitrotoga arctica" is primary cold-adapted NOB enriched from permafrost-affected soils in Siberia, and closely related clones to Nitrotoga were detected in diverse natural habitats such as glacier, a subglacial Antarctic lake, cave biofilm, groundwater and engineered systems operated at low temperature.  However, the ecological and genomic significance of Nitrotoga are big unknown. Recently, Candidatus Nitrotoga sp. AM1 was enriched from coastal water and characterized. Further insight into the biology of Nitrotoga would improve our understanding of nitrogen cycle in natural and engineered habitats.

This study describes the microbial communities of the Lake using high throughput sequencing. Water samples from different times and different depths representing the epi- and hypolimnion were taken at the deepest part of the lake (47°18’ N 8°34’ E). 1-4 L of water were prefiltered through a plankton net (20 μm) and a 5-μm filter and then filtered onto polysulfone filters with a pore size of 0.22 μm. DNA was extracted from the 0.22 μm filter (small, planktonic fraction) to obtain genomic DNA of the microbial community.

Despite their significant biogeochemical roles, the resident microbial communities, especially in the oxygen depleted hypolimnetic compartments are poorly known. In this paper, we present a comprehensive metagenome dataset including shotgun metagenomes from around 30 stratified lakes and ponds mainly located in the boreal and subarctic regions, but also including one reservoir from tropical Puerto Rico and one Swiss lake from the temperate zone. For most lakes and ponds, the data includes a vertical sample set spanning the oxic surface waters to anoxic bottom layers. In addition to the metagenomic sequences, the dataset includes environmental variables for the samples, such as oxygen, nutrient and carbon concentrations. The dataset is ideal for further exploring the microbial taxonomic and functional diversity in freshwater  environments and climate change impacts on the functioning of these ecosystems.

GCA_949281335.1	PRJEB58181	Partial nitritation anammox biofilm colonization	Partial nitritation anammox (PNA) is a biological nitrogen removal process commonly used in wastewater treatment plants during treatment of the warm and nitrogen rich sludge liquor from anaerobic digestion, also known as sidestream wastewater. In these systems biofilms are frequently used to retain biomass from ammonia oxidizing bacteria and anammox bacteria, which together convert ammonium to nitrogen gas. Little is known about how these biofilm communities develop, and whether knowledge about the assembly of biofilm in natural communities can be applied to PNA biofilms. In this study the start-up of full-scale PNA moving bed biofilm reactor was followed for 175 days using shotgun metagenomics. Environmental filtering likely restricted initial biofilm colonization, resulting in low phylogenetic diversity, with the initial microbial community comprised mainly of Proteobacteria. Facilitative priority effects allowed further biofilm colonization, with growth of the initial colonizers facilitating the arrival and growth of anaerobic taxa like methanogens and anammox bacteria. Among the early colonizers were known ‘oligotrophic’ ammonia oxidizers including commamox and Nitrosomonas cluster 6a. Increasing the nitrogen load in the bioreactor allowed colonization by ‘eutrophic’ Nitrosomonas cluster 7 and resulted in the exclusion of the initial ammonia oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers. The results of this study not only contribute to our knowledge about biofilm assembly and PNA bioreactor start-up but could also help guide strategies for the successful implementation of PNA bioreactors.

A widely distributed and important NOB type in cold nitrogen removal systems is Nitrotoga, which however remains understudied due to the scarcity of cultivated representatives. Here, we present genomic features of five Nitrotoga strains from various habitats, including the first obligate marine species enriched from an aquaculture system. Comparative analysis of the Nitrotoga genomes showed, e.g., a unique gene repertoire of the marine strain that could be advantageous in its natural habitat and confirmed the lack of genes for assimilatory nitrite reduction in a strain found to require ammonium for growth. Overall, these data largely broaden our knowledge of Nitrotoga and elucidates the ecological role of this group of nitrite oxidizers.	Extreme,Marine	Marine	SAMEA12177564	Candidatus Nitrotoga sp.

Water samples from different depths representing the epi- and hypolimnion were collected. Approximately 10L of water were pre-filtered through a plankton net (20 μm) and a 5-μm filter and then filtered onto filters with a pore size of 0.22 μm. DNA was extracted from the 0.22 μm (small, planktonic fraction) and 5 μm (large, particulate fraction) filters to obtain genomic DNA of the microbial community. The study also includes time-series metagenomes.

GCA_009885195.1	PRJNA525692	High-Arctic lake sediments are enriched in novel Metagenome Assembled Genomes fit for low temperature and oligotrophy	The Arctic is currently experiencing climate-change related warming, which rapidly affects the environmental constraints on its microbial communities. Yet, our knowledge of the community structure and function of high Arctic freshwater microbes is still lacking, even though they play key roles in nutrient cycling. Here, using high-throughput sequencing, we show that sediment microbial communities in the High Arctic’s largest lake by volume, Lake Hazen, are highly diverse and contain novel organisms which genomes we could reconstruct.

Water samples from different depths representing the epi- and hypolimnion were taken at the deepest part of the lakes. 1-4 L of water were prefiltered through a plankton net (20 μm) and a 5-μm filter and then filtered onto polysulfone filters with a pore size of 0.22 μm. DNA was extracted from the 0.22 μm filter (small, planktonic fraction) to obtain genomic DNA of the microbial community.

GCA_903861565.1	PRJEB38681	Comprehensive dataset of shotgun metagenomes from stratified freshwater lakes and ponds	Stratified lakes and ponds that feature steep oxygen gradients are known to be significant net sources of greenhouse gases and hotspots in the carbon cycle. Despite their significant biogeochemical roles, the resident microbial communities, especially in the oxygen depleted hypolimnetic compartments are poorly known. In this paper, we present a comprehensive metagenome dataset including shotgun metagenomes from around 30 stratified lakes and ponds mainly located in the boreal and subarctic regions, but also including one reservoir from tropical Puerto Rico and one Swiss lake from the temperate zone. For most lakes and ponds, the data includes a vertical sample set spanning the oxic surface waters to anoxic bottom layers. In addition to the metagenomic sequences, the dataset includes environmental variables for the samples, such as oxygen, nutrient and carbon concentrations. The dataset is ideal for further exploring the microbial taxonomic and functional diversity in freshwater  environments and climate change impacts on the functioning of these ecosystems.
